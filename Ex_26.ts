// Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// 1. If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// 2. If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// 3. Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
